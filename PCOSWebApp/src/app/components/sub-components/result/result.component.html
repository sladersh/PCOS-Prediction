          <img [src]="images.doctor" alt="image" />
          <div>
            Consult with a healthcare professional who specializes in
            reproductive health, such as a gynecologist or endocrinologist:
            These specialists can evaluate your symptoms, perform diagnostic
            tests, and provide personalized guidance on managing PCOS. They can
            also rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms.

          <div>
            Get a blood test to check hormone levels, including insulin and
            androgen levels: Blood tests can help determine if hormone
            imbalances are contributing to PCOS symptoms. Insulin resistance and
            elevated androgen levels are common in women with PCOS, and blood
            tests can provide important information for developing a treatment
            plan.

          <img [src]="images.scan" alt="image" />
          <div>
            Undergo an ultrasound to check for cysts on the ovaries: An
            ultrasound can help detect the presence of ovarian cysts, which are
            common in women with PCOS. The ultrasound can also help evaluate the
            thickness of the lining of the uterus and check for other
            conditions, such as fibroids.
          </div>

          <img [src]="images.health" alt="image" />
          <div>
            Maintain a healthy lifestyle through diet and exercise, as weight
            management can have a significant impact on PCOS symptoms:
            Maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise can help
            regulate menstrual cycles, improve insulin resistance, and reduce
            excess hair growth. A healthcare professional can provide
            personalized guidance on developing a healthy diet and exercise
            plan.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img [src]="images.treatment" alt="image" />
          <div>
            Discuss treatment options with a healthcare professional, which may
            include medications to regulate menstrual cycles, control insulin
            resistance, or reduce excess hair growth: Treatment options for PCOS
            may include birth control pills to regulate menstrual cycles,
            anti-androgen medications to reduce excess hair growth, and
            medications to improve insulin sensitivity. A healthcare
            professional can evaluate your symptoms and provide personalized
            guidance on which treatment options may be appropriate for you.

          <img [src]="images.diet" alt="image" />
          <div>
            <strong>Maintain a healthy diet:</strong> Eating a well-balanced
            diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and
            lean proteins can help support reproductive health and overall
            well-being. This can include foods high in nutrients like folate and
            iron, which are important for reproductive health.

        <li>
          <img [src]="images.exercise" alt="image" />
          <div>
            <strong>Exercise regularly:</strong> Regular exercise can help
            maintain a healthy weight, improve cardiovascular health, and reduce
            stress levels, all of which can improve overall health and
            well-being. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity
            exercise, such as brisk walking or cycling, on most days of the
            week.

          <div>
            <strong>Manage stress:</strong> High stress levels can have negative
            impacts on both physical and mental health, so finding ways to
            manage stress is important. This can include practicing relaxation
            techniques like yoga or meditation, getting enough sleep, and
            engaging in hobbies or activities that you enjoy.

          <div>
            <strong>Get regular check-ups:</strong> Even if you're not at risk
            for PCOS or other reproductive health conditions, it's important to
            get regular check-ups with your healthcare provider. This can
            include pelvic exams, Pap smears, and other tests to ensure that
            everything is functioning properly.
